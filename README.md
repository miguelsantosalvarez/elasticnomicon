# Elasticnomicon
This repo contains some recipes to create lab environments (hopefuly) with less effort
## Usage
For each recipe there's a folder with a different environment where to deploy Elastic Stack.
Once you get there you'll have the specific instructions in the README.md file.

Best of luck on your tests!
